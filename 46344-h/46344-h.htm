<p class="pn p4">On the 15th June, 1887, the State of Pennsylvania
provided for the erection of a Memorial
Tablet, or Monument, for each of the Pennsylvania
Commands that participated in the Battle of
Gettysburg, July 1st, 2d and 3d, 1863.</p>

<p>At a Re-Union of the 84th Regiment held at Huntingdon,
Pa., 21st September, 1887, Captain Thos. E.
Merchant, Gen. Geo. Zinn, Adjutant Edmund Mather,
Sergeant A. J. Hertzler, and Henry L. Bunker, were
appointed a Committee on Monument, with full power
to act as to design, inscription and dedication.</p>

<p>The dates, September 11th and 12th, 1889, were
named by the Governor of the Commonwealth to be
"Pennsylvania Days"&mdash;Wednesday, the 11th, for the
dedication of the Monuments by the Associations of
the respective Commands; and Thursday, the 12th, for
the transfer of the Monuments to the State.</p>

<p>On the 10th August, 1889, full information of the
Day was sent to every Soldier of the 84th, whose address
was known, and the response had in the attendance
of one hundred and forty-six Comrades, coming from
all parts of the State and some from beyond, spoke forcibly
to the memory, and testified clearly to the reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the old Command. The presence of so large a number
so many years after the War, tended to, and did,
awaken the most earnest feeling, and every one knew
how great was the loss to the Comrades not there.</p>

<p>The introductory words at the Monument by the
Vice-President of the Regimental Association, Captain
Robert Johnson, were highly appropriate to the occasion,
and marked the earnestness of the ceremony in
which the Soldiers of the 84th were now engaged.</p>

<p>The Chaplain of the Association, Rev. John P. Norman,
Surgeon of the Regiment, offered Prayer.</p>

<p>Letters from absent Comrades were read by Adjutant
Mather.</p>

<p>Gen. Joseph B. Carr, whose Brigade (the 1st, 2d
Division, 3d Corps) in the Gettysburg Campaign included
the 84th, had expressed his earnest wish to be
present at the dedication, a feeling on his part highly
gratifying to Soldiers who had served under so able a
Commander.</p>

<p>While desiring it to be understood that he was there
as a hearer, to witness the services, he felt that he could
not properly refuse to respond to the request for a talk,
which he did most cheerfully.</p>

<p>His words, written in granite, would stand as a Monument
of Honor to the Regiment so long as the stone
would endure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>A group picture, taken at the time of the dedication,
will be of lasting interest. At no time since their muster-out
had there been so many Soldiers of the Regiment
touching elbow, and never, this side, will there be
again so many.</p>

<p class="b4">The Address by Captain Merchant, Chairman of the
Committee on Monument, is published in compliance
with the expressed desire of the surviving members of
the Regiment.</p>

<p class="pn p4">Soldiers of the Eighty-Fourth Regiment
Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers:</p>

<p>If the feeling with which these words of salutation
are heard and accepted, is like unto the feeling
that prompts their utterance, then are we fully compensated
in our coming together.</p>

<p>We name the old Regiment, and what recollections
crowd in upon us; memories of the camp, the march, and
the field. Some fond&mdash;many weighted with the touch
of sorrow felt in its heavy burden even until now,
through all of so much of time.</p>

<p>In the presence of these recollections I could not hope
to control your thought. I would not ask you simply
to follow words as I speak them, but rather that you be
all of memory, all of feeling, thinking, listening the
while if you can, but surely thinking. For in thought
you can cover more ground in moments than I could
travel for you in days.</p>

<p>Together you comprise the Whole Book, the turning
of whose pages wakens memory to every detail, while
from the one individual you can have no more than
the head-lines to the volume whose contents you are so
familiar with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Together you know what our Regiment was; alone
I can but outline to you, and that roughly, a meagre
part of the full story of the 84th.</p>

<p>Its history could be found only in the everything
that could be told by each of all the hundreds, living
and dead, who numbered its total strength. But where
your special individual interest lies it is not possible
for me to tread. I wish I could tell the story of every
Company, relate the incidents of every mess, and note
the experiences of every individual.</p>

<p>Many the time we have recalled our comradeship,
more especially with those with whom we were brought
in the closer association. It would be a pleasant theme
were I at liberty to name the latter and their never-forgotten
deeds, that I might place on record my keen
appreciation of their kindly acts at a time when kindness
was most to be valued, and fidelity most to be
prized. But in whatever I do upon this occasion, I
stand reminded that I am not to tread over again my
individual walk, nor speak again my personal conversation.
What is said&mdash;what is done&mdash;shall be, so far
as may be, of all for all.</p>

<p>Not many of us had the opportunity to know very
much outside the limits of the Company; and fewer of
us beyond the limits of the Regiment. And it was well
for good service that the majority of soldiers were content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with the work assigned them, and gave but little
heed to the details of location of armies or corps, and
but little thought to the place of divisions or brigades.</p>

<p>Who was the best-posted man on the news? Who
the readiest army talker? Who the general of the
camp? The soldier who was not to be found in the
place his enlistment called for at the time when his
presence would have told the most. It was well for the
service that he did not number many.</p>

<p>The good soldier ought not to think it strange, that
while in everything he did his duty well, he does not
know much of what was done by regiments other than
his own, and would be at a loss to name the number of
his brigade. Nor must he think that the comrade who
stood side by side with him is the only one mistaken as
to the occurrences of the day. It would not always be
well to accept a soldier of F Co. as a conclusive witness
of what took place in E, if there was dispute as to the
bearing of the line, or question as to who were the first
to advance; and yet, no one will bend the ear more
gladly than myself to the recitals of a soldier in fact,
because I know he gives us the truth as he believes it.
And if from the data thus gathered, I count that his
regiment was killed, or permanently disabled, <i>twice
over</i>, I attribute the outcome to a lack somewhere in the
arithmetic, and not to a vice in the teller. And, in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
connection, we must not overlook the fact of the years
that have rolled by.</p>

<p>Twenty-four years and upward in the circle of time
measures the distance of our close, very close, comradeship.
Years more than many of us had numbered
prior to the beginning, four years before, of the long
campaign. The time that preceded and that which has
followed, make up the life ordinary. The long four
years was the life within the other life. In it was contained
the greatest of all wars from the world's beginning&mdash;the
war against the Rebellion of '61.</p>

<p>Hirelings were not upon either side. It was man
against man in the fight. Soldier pitted against soldier.
Each individual fighting the issue which so nearly concerned
himself. It was the greatest of rebellions against
the grandest of governments. If successful, to the
world it would have been the greatest and grandest of
revolutions.</p>

<p>It was not a conflict forced merely for the perpetuation
of slavery. It was the institution of the crown,
and not preservation of the chattel, that most moved
the men who moved the South from '89 to '61.</p>

<p>One people in Government, and yet in sentiment and
practices as far removed as two nationalities.</p>

<p>Forced together for mutual protection, yet from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beginning thoroughly divided in appreciation of the
powers of a free Government.</p>

<p>In human direction, it was but a run of time when,
as a Government for the whole people, the central
power would be called upon to assert itself by the power
of might.</p>

<p>Neither of the existing conditions would have won
to the United States a constitution for their government
such as was fixed upon and has come along, in its
working, through all of a hundred years, without a
break in any of its provisions. Every line of it, as to
matters upon which men could differ, was agreed upon for
submission to the States, because necessity admitted of
no other course for them, and live. Well was it for
stability of government that, when the substance had
passed the gauntlet of discussion, the words had been
so well placed, that not a letter was found astray when
the great test came. No document of State has, or ever
will, surpass it in sublimity of thought, arrangement of
detail, clearness of expression, or force of power.</p>

<p>In the assertion of the binding powers of this Constitution,
the 84th had a part, and <i>you</i> were a part of
the 84th.</p>

<p>Your Regiment was to you the command which centred
your soldier life. And well content may you be
in the fact that its character secured for it a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
which, to every one of us, has been a thing of just and
affectionate pride. I studied that character at a time
when I felt it was everything to me. My varied experiences
in the several positions in company and regiment,
which I occupied, enabled me to found a judgment
which has been very clearly and most positively
strengthened by every knowledge since acquired. The
tenor of that judgment you will gather as I proceed, in
an imperfect way, to tell you a part of what you did in
three years and nine months of soldier life.</p>


<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Recruiting and Organization.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">In the month of July, 1861, authority was granted,
directly by the Secretary of War, to recruit in the western
part of Pennsylvania the <i>Mountain Brigade</i>, to be
composed of Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery; and upon
its organization to be mustered into the service of the
United States.</p>

<p>Among the persons named in the order was one J.
Y. James, who was to be assigned to the command of
the troops when thus organized.</p>

<p>The recruiting camp for the Infantry was located
three miles out of the town of Huntingdon, on the
Warm Springs Road.</p>

<p>In accordance with the purpose that the recruiting
and organization of the Brigade should be under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
direction of a Regular Army officer, Captain Crossman,
of the Quartermaster's Department, United States Army,
was detailed by the War Department for that duty,
hence the name given to the camp to which the early
recruits of the 84th ever looked back as their original
soldier home, and the birth-place of the Regiment.</p>

<p>The projectors of the Brigade had reached out to
three regiments of Infantry, to be numbered, respectively,
84, 110, and, somewhat uncertain but said to be,
39.</p>

<p>I have given the numbers in the order named, placing
the 84th at the head, in view of the fact that its
commander was to be the ranking regimental officer of
the Brigade.</p>

<p>William G. Murray, Blair County, was selected as
the Colonel of the 84th;</p>

<p>William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia, as Colonel of the
110th; and</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Curtis, of Philadelphia, as Colonel of the
third regiment.</p>

<p>Whatever was done toward the building up of the
last-named regiment came to naught by the promulgation
of an order transferring its recruits to the 110th,
and making transfers from the 110th to the 84th.
While the reason for this double transfer has been intimated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it is not so certainly correct as to justify its
statement as altogether fact.</p>

<p>The brigade feature failed of accomplishment. Cavalry
nor Artillery put in an appearance; and James,
the proposed Brigade Commander, did not identify
himself with either regiment.</p>

<p>But, while James did not become commander of the
Mountain Brigade, the attempt to so locate him did
place in the field two of the most efficient among all the
regiments that entered their country's service in the
War of the Rebellion, whether in the Army of the
Shenandoah, the Army of Virginia, the Army of the
Potomac, or any other of the armies of the Union.</p>

<p>Recruiting for the 84th commenced early in the
month of August, the first enlistment date on the roll
being the 16th of that month.</p>

<p>I do not venture the name of the first soldier of the
Regiment, lest, like to the naming of the youngest boy
in the army, I might afterwards be met with scores of
avowals that the record does not show strictly correct.
Then, again, the serenity of manner, and mildness of
word, with which a soldier is wont to put a criticism,
makes it desirable to avoid placing such a necessity before
him, if a simple omission will save his feeling upon
the particular point, and the service be in no way injured
thereby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23d of October, the Regimental organization
was effected.</p>

<p>In November, the Regiment was ordered to report at
Camp Curtin, which most Pennsylvania soldiers remember
so well as overlooking Harrisburg. Here the
enlistments were continued, and on the 23d of December
the officers and men were mustered as a regiment
into the service of the United States for three years,
there being at the time nine companies, "H" omitted.</p>

<p>Two days previous to the muster, the Regiment was
presented by Governor Curtin, on behalf of the State,
with the Colors.</p>

<p class="p2">Murray's selection for the Colonelcy of the 84th may
be attributed to the part which he took as an officer in
the Mexican War, where he did honorable and praiseworthy
service.</p>

<p>Several of the men had responded promptly to the
first call for three months' troops, and were now on their
way for the <i>longer</i> term.</p>


<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Off to the "Front."</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 31st of December, the last day of the year,
1861, acting upon orders received to report at Hancock,
Maryland, the Regiment left Harrisburg at two o'clock
in the afternoon, on a train made up of twenty-one cars,
for Hagerstown, where it arrived at six o'clock in the
evening of that day.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">First March.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the first of January, 1862, early in the morning,
began the first in the long series of the weary, footsore,
leg-tiring, patience-testing and body-exhausting
marches which were to be taken in the coming three
and a half years.</p>

<p>The morning was cold&mdash;cold enough to do full justice
to the time of the season and the season of the year,
what we characterize a bitter day, and a bitter experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was it for the boys who were yet to learn the attendants
of war. A driving wind, with a fall of snow,
made what would have been a more than uncomfortable
bivouac for the night, were it not that to the weary
traveller there is not less of comfort in stopping than
in going. It was the less for the greater hardship, and
the freezing could go on through the night unaccompanied
by the strain of the march.</p>

<p>Clear Spring had been left behind through the day,
and the stop at night was without tents.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Arrival at the "Front."</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Nine o'clock of the 2d marked the Regiment again
on the way, and on the mountain top at Fairview was
had the first sight of secession land, the Dixie of the
song, and then on to Hancock, by the bank of the Potomac,
the terminal of the order that initiated the war
service that started active, and on that line developed,
continuously, to a fulness sufficient to meet the hardiest
speculations of the most radical expectant.</p>

<p>The National Pike furnished the roadway from Hagerstown
to Hancock.</p>

<p>The arrival at Hancock was in the evening of the
2d. The Regiment was put in quarters just vacated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the 13th Massachusetts, which had been passed on its
way down the river in canal boats.</p>

<p>The day of arrival at Hancock was in the ninth
month of a War that had not been lacking in vigor of
movement on the part of the foe which the Government
had encountered, and yet so little of system had been
attained, and so little of war wisdom sought after, that
a regiment of soldiers was travelled from Harrisburg
without arms, and that to a point just across a river,
narrow and shallow, from where lie the forces whose
movements the regiment had been sent to check.</p>

<p>On the 3d, the guns were handed out. They were
of the old Belgian make, containing all the tallow that
the barrel would accommodate in addition to the several
cartridges necessary to be supplied before the
moistened powder could be induced to ignite. When
they were carried over into Virginia, and the warmth
of the fire reached the explosive grain, you can think
now, as you realized then, that even the Belgian was
not built to throw more than one ball at the same fire
without repairs to one or the other&mdash;the gun or the
man.</p>

<p>But why <i>say</i>, or even <i>think</i> fault of what was done,
for what was not done, then. Everybody is wiser now.</p>

<p>Through all its after course the Regiment proved
itself full worthy of the reputation, at that time, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
early in its history, at the very beginning of its first
campaign, impliedly accorded it, that it would go
wherever ordered to go, and pick up on the way whatever
could be found most effective for the best work.</p>

<p>And there was the full Regulation uniform. The
appearance presented in the dark blue, the tail coat, the
plentiful hat, and the extra cap. Who can say that
these things were not sufficient to keep Stonewall Jackson
on the other side, notwithstanding the apparent absence
of arms? for, competent soldier that he was, he
could not have been induced to believe that, in the
ninth month of the War, a regiment of United States
<i>Regulars</i> would have been permitted at the front without
all requisite paraphernalia close at hand.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Initial Encounter with the Enemy.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the night of the 3d, the Regiment was crossed
over the Potomac on scows, and marched six miles
across the country to Bath, the summer resort known as
Berkly Springs.</p>

<p>Here were met Captain Russell's company of First
Maryland Cavalry, two companies of the 39th Illinois
Infantry, and a section of Artillery, two guns, with
which force the 84th was to co-operate, with Colonel
Murray, the ranking officer, in command.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 4th, from out of Bath, up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the mountain top, and there formed in line. From this
point the rebel army could be plainly seen advancing
along the three roads; Jackson's force of 10,000, consisting
of Ewell's, Longstreet's and Early's brigades,
supplemented by Ashby's Cavalry.</p>

<p>A detail from the Regiment was thrown out as pickets
or skirmishers. It is hardly required to say that
these were forced back as the enemy moved on, until
our small force was almost surrounded. Sufficient show
of strength was kept up to deter Jackson from moving
faster.</p>

<p>About one o'clock in the afternoon, word was had
that the Artillery had exhausted their ammunition,
and Murray concluded to fall back. The Regiment
could not return by the way it had come. A guide was
sought, found and pressed into the service. His inclination
was much toward the other side, and he soon
showed himself more desirous of coming up with Ashby
than of pointing out a safe approach to the river. At
one point he came so near the accomplishment of his
purpose, that Murray gave him a gentle caution in
about these words: If one of my men loses his life by
your movement, your own life will be the forfeit. Thus
kindly admonished, the guide changed the course of the
march and conducted the Regiment to Sir John's Run,
six miles up the river, from which point the way was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
along the railroad, under the high bluffs, to the old
mill opposite Hancock.</p>

<p>The problem now presented was how to avoid attack
while recrossing. Upon Captain Russell's suggestion
the two companies of the 39th Illinois were placed in
ambush, while he so disposed his men as to draw Ashby
on. The man&oelig;uvre worked well, and Ashby was so
much surprised by the unexpected fire as to desist from
further attempt.</p>

<p>Some of the men, to avoid the delay attending the
slow navigation of the ancient ferry, adopted the alternative
of wading the stream, trusting to the artillery
fire of the enemy to warm them up by the time they
reached the other side.</p>

<p>In the crossing, one man was lost to the Regiment&mdash;whether
to the world is to this hour a question.</p>

<p>As an addendum to the story of the muskets, it may
be stated that the Regiment crossed the river without
belts, cartridge boxes or cap pouches, carrying the
cartridges in one pocket and the caps in the other.
This omission was for want of time to adjust the belts.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that less than a thousand men
were thus successful in holding so many thousand in
check for an entire day, and without death, wound or
capture of a man. However, the good service was in
fact done, and history is no more remiss as to this event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
than it is as to the deprivation, toil and fighting of all
the campaign in the Valley to July of '62.</p>

<p>On the night of the 4th, General Lander arrived at
Hancock and assumed command of all the troops.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Joined by the 110th.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The regiment that was to go side by side with the
84th for the coming eighteen months, now composed a
part of the force at Hancock, the 110th Pa.</p>

<p>The enemy kept up the artillery fire from the bluffs
opposite until midnight.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th, under cover of a flag of
truce, Ashby came over the river and was met at the
bank by Colonel Murray. Ashby was blindfolded and
conducted to the quarters of "B" company, into a room
occupied by the Captain, 1st Lieutenant, and 1st Sergeant.
The bandage being removed, Ashby put the
question: "Who did you say is in command here?"
Murray replied: "I do not think I said <i>who</i> is in command."
Ashby's expert question not bringing the expected
reply, he then delivered to Murray the message
he had from Jackson, a demand of the commanding
officer of the troops for the surrender of the town within
two hours, or he would shell it. Murray turned Ashby
over to the care of Sergeant Mather, while he went to
General Lander to repeat Jackson's demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Lander was desirous of knowing how long our men
would stand under fire, and upon being assured by
Murray that they had acted very well the day before,
he refused the demand, in terms much emphasized, with
the suggestion, that if Jackson wanted the town he
would have to take it.</p>

<p>When Murray had delivered Lander's reply to Ashby,
he reconducted the latter to the river bank, and Ashby
recrossed.</p>

<p>The details of this incident are given as showing the
aptness of the commander of the 84th for a sudden and
trying occasion.</p>

<p>Notice was given to the citizens of the threatened
shelling, and they were not long in getting beyond artillery
limits.</p>

<p>Our men were placed in the streets at points best
adapted for checking any attempt of the enemy to cross.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the fire commenced and continued
through the day.</p>

<p>On the 6th, the artillery fire was mostly from our
side.</p>

<p>On the 7th and 8th, reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>This mid-winter movement of Jackson from Winchester
was for the purpose of capturing the stores at
Romney, Virginia, by surprise of the small force stationed
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Lander became aware of Jackson's purpose
he started off in a two-horse wagon, accompanied
only by his Adjutant; drove as rapidly as he could
along the National Pike to Cumberland, then across
the river, and from there to Romney, in time to prevent
the hoped-for surprise, and to get the troops away
with all the stores that could be removed, destroying
the remainder.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">March to Cumberland.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 10th, started from Hancock in company with
the 110th Pa. and Andrews' Independent Company of
Sharp Shooters, marched 18 miles, stopping at half
past two the next morning.</p>

<p>A detail from the Regiment boarded a canal boat
loaded with ammunition, as a guard to Cumberland.
Their saving of a march was somewhat offset by a keen
appreciation of the situation, knowing that a well-directed,
or even stray, shot would destroy the boat and
all of the boat load. The hoofs of the motive power
were muffled to deaden the tramp of the mule.</p>

<p>Continued, on the 11th, along the National Pike, the
last contingent reaching Cumberland on the 12th, and
closing a forced march of 40 miles.</p>

<p>Jackson, baffled in his purpose, returned to Winchester.
His Georgia troops especially suffered severely
from their winter march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 16th, from Cumberland to North Branch
Bridge on the Virginia side.</p>

<p>On the 17th, at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, review of all the troops.</p>

<p>On the 25th, first muster for pay, and on</p>

<p>February 5th, first pay drawn.</p>

<p>On the 6th, at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, taken on cars to South Branch
Bridge, this being the beginning of the movement to
re-open the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Cumberland
down.</p>

<p>On the 9th, reached Paw-Paw Tunnel, and bivouacked
in the snow.</p>

<p>On the 10th, put up tents along the river; known as
Camp Chase; and</p>

<p>On the 11th, reviewed by Colonel Kimball.</p>

<p>On the 13th, all the troops, excepting the 84th Pa.
and 7th Va., left for Winchester, along with the artillery.</p>

<p>On the 21st, first battalion drill.</p>

<p>22d, review by General Lander.</p>

<p>28th, ordered to be ready to move at a moment's
notice.</p>

<p>On March 2d, at Paw-Paw, occurred the death of
General Lander from wound received at Balls Bluff.
Colonel Kimball succeeded to the command.</p>

<p>On the 3d, obsequies attending General Lander's
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th, marched as far as Back Creek, 8 miles
below Hancock, on the Virginia side. At this creek
the Regiment crossed on a suspension bridge of two
wire ropes with boards laid thereon, sixty feet above the
water.</p>

<p>At two o'clock on the morning of the 7th, arrived at
Martinsburg.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Assigned to Shields' Division.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 8th, by order of the President, the troops
operating in Virginia were classed in Five Army Corps&mdash;the
5th comprised of Banks' and Shields' Divisions,
the 84th being assigned to the 2d Brigade (Carroll),
2d Division (Shields), 5th Corps (Banks).</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Shenandoah Valley Campaign.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 11th, from Martinsburg at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, reaching
Bunker's Hill at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, from there at 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, halting
at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> of the 12th, 18 miles from Martinsburg and
four from Winchester. At 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> advanced one-half
mile and formed line. Winchester occupied by Union
troops. Artillery fire kept up through the day of the
13th.</p>

<p>On the night of the 14th, tents arrived and were put
up on the ground known as Camp Kimball, two miles
north of Winchester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 18th, moved at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, through Winchester,
marching 14 miles in the direction of Strasburg.</p>

<p>On the 19th, marched through Strasburg and three
miles beyond, when it was learned that Jackson had
burned the bridge at Cedar Creek. Returned to within
one mile of Strasburg, and</p>

<p>On the 20th, our troops took up the march for Winchester,
covering the distance, 21 miles, through mud
and rain, without a halt, and reaching Camp Kimball
at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>Banks now supposed that Jackson had departed with
his army from the Valley, and, in that belief, moved
all his force, with the exception of Shields' Division,
east of the Blue Ridge, and, on the morning of the 22d,
himself started for Washington. Only a few hours
later, 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and Ashby's artillery made known to
Shields that Jackson had returned.</p>

<p>Shields immediately advanced a part of his Division,
commanding in person, with orders to Kimball, whose
Brigade included the 84th, to follow with the remainder
to a point on the Pike two miles south of Winchester.</p>

<p>It was at 4.30 when the Regiment received orders to
"Fall-in."</p>

<p>Shields was brought back wounded, having been
struck by a piece of shell. This placed Kimball in
immediate command on the field, though Shields, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his quarters in the rear, continued through the remainder
of this and the following day to receive information
of the situation, and, as far as he possibly could,
direct the course to be taken.</p>

<p>Between five and six o'clock the Regiment was ordered
to the side of the road and there laid through the
night.</p>

<p>At the close of the day Jackson's whole force was
about half way between Winchester and Kernstown.</p>

<p>Again the error was committed in supposing that
Jackson was out of the way.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Winchester.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the morning of Sunday, the 23d, the Regiment
was ordered into camp on the left of the Kernstown
Road, and it was while Colonel Murray was engaged in
laying out the ground, word came that a battle was at
hand, and immediately the order was given to "Fall in."</p>

<p>The artillery fire opened about eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>The Regiment was ordered to take position on the
extreme right of the Division line, and about 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
was ordered to the centre in support of Clark's Regular
and Robinson's Ohio Batteries.</p>

<p>The attack on the left of the Division at this time
was successfully met by Sullivan's Brigade.</p>

<p>After this repulse, Jackson's attention was directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to our right. Passing his troops along our front, under
cover of the woods, he took a position commanding the
right of the Division and with a view to turning that
flank and getting to our rear. To aid in this movement,
with his men well protected, he started a furious
fire from his guns at a distance of half a mile.</p>

<p>About four o'clock the order came from Kimball to
Murray to charge straight up to the battery and take
it if possible.</p>

<p>The place of the battery was the very key to the
enemy's position.</p>

<p>That hour, near the close of that March day, the 23d,
made for the 84th Pa. a reputation which was never for
a moment blurred in any of its after course. The Regiment
equalled itself on other fields, at other times, but
it never could have had the opportunity to surpass the
gallantry, the true bravery, the manly courage, the
noble heroism, the devotion to country, displayed at
Winchester, its first battle.</p>

<p>As it did then, so it did always. Wherever ordered
to go it went. Through forest, across open field, was
no matter in the execution of the order to go. Its Soldiers
never stopped to estimate the probable result.
Casualties were noted only after the battle, when they
went upon the roll as unalterable fact.</p>

<p>On this day, over the intervening space, went the
Regiment, and Murray with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt, then, of the moral worth of their commander.
No waver of thought then as to the true courage
of their leader. But for one moment following upon
the contest, in which for officers and men to have spoken
to him the word which would have been their every
assurance, that in the sure test of a soldier he had proved
himself all that could have been asked for, and more.
But time, <i>this side</i>, with him, had stopped, ere the Regiment
crossed the line of its victory. Where the Regiment
was to strike his line, the enemy was in strong
position on the edge of a wood, behind natural breast-works
of rocks and hillocks, and with two hundred
yards of open space to his front.</p>

<p>The moment the order to charge was received, the
Regiment started off by the flank, the Pioneer corps in
the advance to take down fences. Down the hill, over
the meadow ground and through the woods to the opening,
all the time exposed to the rebel artillery fire.</p>

<p>Unsupported on either flank, the Regiment pressed
forward in line, up the slope, two-thirds of the distance
across the open space, and halted just before reaching
the top.</p>

<p>Colonel Murray knew that the Regiment could not
stay where it was. To his Adjutant he said: "We
cannot hold this place; we must either advance or retreat,
and we will not retreat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Both his Field Officers were absent. His horse had
been killed, as had also that of his Adjutant, and he
was now dismounted.</p>

<p>Waiting only long enough for his Adjutant to make
known his purpose to the Company Commanders, Murray
gave the order to "Charge!" Promptly the order
was obeyed, and he and his Regiment were well on the
way, when he fell, without a word, instantly killed, his
forehead pierced by a ball, seemingly guided in its
course by the flash of the figures 8 and 4 upon his cap,
through which the bullet crashed on its way to claim
the life which thus far had led the Regiment that was
to turn the tide.</p>

<p>Inspired as they were by so noble an example, even
so great a loss, at so critical a moment, did not stop the
Regiment in its course.</p>

<p>Without a Field Officer, on they went, until within
twenty paces, or less, of that well-protected line, and
there stood, firing and receiving the greater fire, never
thinking to go back, not knowing but that they were
there to stay, either as soldiers fighting in the ranks, or
lying, helpless, cheering their comrades on&mdash;or dead.</p>

<p>The 14th Indiana coming up, aided in forcing the
enemy's line, and Tyler's Brigade having forced the
line behind the stone fence in their front, the battle was
over. The enemy was pursued a mile or more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
under cover of night Jackson started his whole army,
which before morning was in full retreat up the Valley,
leaving the victory of Winchester to Shields' Division.</p>

<p class="p2">The 84th numbered 255 in the battle. At its close
it numbered 92 less. Three officers and eighteen men
killed. Two officers and sixty-nine men wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Gallagher, "E" Co., and Lieutenant Reem,
"A" Co., were among the killed.</p>

<p class="p2">The poetical side of the Regiment is shown in the
following verses:</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">By Toodles.</span></p>

<p class="pn center reduct p1">BY JAMES GAILY.</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">When Col. Murray drew his sword,<br />
It was in Freedom's cause,</p>
<p class="ppn20">To fight against the rebels,<br />
That defied our Flag and laws.</p>
<p class="ppn20">The Pennsylvania Eighty-fourth,<br />
Of which he had command,</p>
<p class="ppn20"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Against the rebels, ten to one,<br />
At Hancock made a stand.</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">It was the twenty-third of March,<br />
Near Winchester we lay,</p>
<p class="ppn20">At eight o'clock the shell and shot,<br />
On us began to play.</p>
<p class="ppn20">When Gen'l Shields, that never yields,<br />
He heard the distant noise,</p>
<p class="ppn20">Then faced about and with a shout,<br />
Said, "Double-quick, my boys."</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">When Gen'l Shields came on the field,<br />
They fought like heroes brave,</p>
<p class="ppn20">With sword in hand he gave command,<br />
Our flag did proudly wave.</p>
<p class="ppn20">Although our Regiment suffered most,<br />
They did not shrink or fail,</p>
<p class="ppn20">Their gallant Colonel led them on<br />
Through storms of iron hail.</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">The Eighty-fourth was ordered up<br />
To charge the enemy,</p>
<p class="ppn20">To drive the rebels from their guns,<br />
And save their battery.</p>
<p class="ppn20">Like veterans they made their charge,<br />
It was conducted well,</p>
<p class="ppn20">But in the mid'st of victory,<br />
Our gallant Murray fell.</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">He boldly led the Eighty-fourth,<br />
Until he was shot dead;</p>
<p class="ppn20">While bravely cheering on his men<br />
A bullet pierced his head.</p>
<p class="ppn20"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Their fire seemed directed most<br />
Against the Eighty-fourth,</p>
<p class="ppn20">But hand to hand they could not stand<br />
Our tigers of the North.</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">The Stars and Stripes of Liberty,<br />
That always lead to fame,</p>
<p class="ppn20">Linked with its brave defenders now<br />
Is Col. Murray's name.</p>
<p class="ppn20">And soon they will avenge his death,<br />
The gallant Eighty-fourth,</p>
<p class="ppn20">For none but those who knew him well<br />
Could estimate his worth.</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">The gallant officers and men,<br />
Receive our heart-felt thanks,</p>
<p class="ppn20">They would not fly but rather die,<br />
Within the Union ranks.</p>
<p class="ppn20">The rose and evergreen will bloom,<br />
Upon the honored grave</p>
<p class="ppn20">Of Col. William G. Murray,<br />
The bravest of the brave.</p>

<p class="pn p1">The account of the battle in the New York <i>World</i>,
as reported by its correspondent, contained the following:</p>

<p>"The 84th Pa. suffered more than any other. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Regiment, of which there were only 300 engaged
(proper number 255), lost 23 killed and 63 wounded
from the bullets of the enemy, among them Col.
Murray."</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">General Order by Governor Curtin.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">In "General Order No. 20, Harrisburg, April 4th,
1862," Governor Curtin spoke as follows: "The example
of the gallant Colonel Murray, of the 84th,
who fell at the head of his Regiment in the conflict at
Winchester, with that of the noble men of his command,
who there gave their lives a willing sacrifice to
their Country, must stimulate all who have enlisted in
the service to increased devotion, while their memory
will be cherished by every patriot and add honor to
the arms of Pennsylvania and the Union."</p>


<p class="p2">On the day after Winchester, Banks with part of his
Corps went past in pursuit of the enemy, now on their
way up the Valley.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the Regiment marched to Cedar Creek
and return, 24 miles.</p>

<p>On the 26th, Detail ordered to bury the dead.</p>

<p>On the 27th, marched 12 miles to Berryville, arriving
at four o'clock, and the Regiment assigned to
Provost Duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>On April 3d, General Banks was assigned by the
War Department to the command of the Department
of the Shenandoah, and General McDowell to the
Department of the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. MacDowell joined the Regiment, for the
first time, at Berryville, but remained only a short
time, owing to the condition of his health.</p>

<p>On April 22d, the Regiment went from Berryville
to Winchester, arriving at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>Order of General Shields, congratulating the troops
on their bravery at Winchester, was read.</p>

<p>General Blencker, passing through Winchester with
his command, personally complimented the 84th for the
part taken in the battle.</p>

<p>On May 4th, Regiment ordered to join the Division
as soon as relieved, and on the</p>

<p>10th, relieved by five companies of the 10th Maine.</p>

<p>The Regiment was now a part of the 4th Brigade,
2d Division, old 5th Corps.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">March to Fredericksburg.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 11th, started at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and marched to Cedar
Creek, 15 miles.</p>

<p>On the 12th, started at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and moved 4 miles to
West of Strasburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 13th, 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, moved from Strasburg to Middletown,
6 miles, arriving at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>On the 14th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, to Front Royal, fording the
Shenandoah, 12 miles. Quartered in rebel hospital.</p>

<p>On the 15th, whole of Shields' Division at Middletown.</p>

<p>On the 16th, marched with the supply train over the
Blue Ridge, 10 miles toward Warrenton, stopping at
6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>On the 17th, marched from 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, 15
miles.</p>

<p>On the 18th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, passing through Warrenton;
stopped at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, 12 miles.</p>

<p>On the 19th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, arrived at Duryea's camp 11
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 6 miles.</p>

camp opposite Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>23d, portion of army reviewed by President Lincoln.
84th not in review.</p>

<p>As soon as Lee learned of the withdrawal of Shields'
Division from the Valley, he started Jackson after
Banks. Ewell and Jackson, combined, numbered over
twenty thousand. Banks had about four thousand
men. The first attack was at Winchester, on the 25th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and Banks was pressed, without regard to convenience
of movement, until he was over the Potomac.</p>

<p>Shields' Division had been in front of Fredericksburg
but three days, when on the</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Back to the Valley.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">25th, at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, they were again on the march back to
the Valley, to stop the new trouble there. 8 miles
covered the first day.</p>

<p>On the 26th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 22 miles, to within one mile of
Catlett Station, arriving at 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>On the 27th, changed position, 2 miles.</p>

<p>On the 28th, 12 miles to Haymarket.</p>

<p>On the 29th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 15 miles to Rectortown, pitched
tents, and at 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> started for Front Royal, marched
all night, and reached there 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>On the 30th, the Louisiana and Georgia troops had
been driven out through the day by Colonel Nelson's
Rhode Island Cavalry.</p>

<p>On the 31st, 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, went 4 miles out on the Winchester
Pike, skirmishing with the enemy, accompanied
by two pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>By this time Jackson was aware of the situation,
which he had not apprehended when he was bent on
routing Banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>He now realized that Banks was beyond capture and
safe; that he must leave the Potomac to his rear; that
in so doing Banks would have the advantage of pursuing
a retreating column; that on his retreat he would
probably run against Fremont, and could not evade
Shields.</p>

<p>He knew that he had but one way to go. He knew
there was but one way of escape, and that over the
bridge at Port Republic.</p>

<p>June 1st, Shields' Division took up its part of the
program and went 10 miles toward Luray, and on the</p>

<p>2d, 15 miles further in the same direction.</p>

<p>On the 4th, arrived at Columbia Bridge, near Luray.</p>

<p>On the 5th and 6th, remained at Columbia Bridge,
and on the</p>

<p>7th, marched during the night, reaching Port Republic
on the morning of the 8th.</p>

<p class="p2">The advance of Fremont's forces had struck the rear
guard of Jackson, in retreat, on the 1st, 5 miles from
Strasburg, which brought on skirmishing, and on the
7th, 4 miles beyond Harrissonburg, a fight took place
between the advance of Fremont's Corps and Jackson's
rear guard, and on the 8th was fought the battle of
Cross Keys, between Fremont's Corps and Jackson's
troops, lasting from 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> till 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Port Republic.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Thus far the Massanutten Mountains had separated
Jackson and his immediate pursuers from Shields.
This mountain range stops just before reaching Port
Republic. The only troops in the town were the four
regiments of Carroll's Brigade, 1st Va., 7th Ind., 84th
and 110th Pa., about sixteen hundred strong.</p>

<p>"At this point," read the orders to General Shields,
"you will intercept Jackson and cut off his retreat."</p>

<p>With the bridge standing, Carroll's force, or even the
entire Division, would be a mere handful against the
foe now almost at hand.</p>

<p>The effectual cut-off would have been the destruction
of the bridge, and had there been but one man there,
in place of a brigade, he would have destroyed it.</p>

<p>Did Shields order Carroll to burn the bridge?</p>

<p>And, if so, did Carroll think it would be more soldierly
to fight the whole rebel army?</p>

<p>Whatever the answer, the fact remains that the
bridge was not burned. When the attempt was made
it was too late.</p>

<p>Over the bridge was Jackson's only way of escape
from Fremont. When he found Carroll there he
moved up his advance, under cover of the night, quietly
posted twenty guns where they would command the
way over the river, and opened them at daylight. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fire was too much to stand against, and over the bridge
came Jackson's cavalry, followed by his columns of
infantry, and having forced our small command back
the Luray Valley to Conrad's Store, and burned the
bridge to avoid further trouble with Fremont, he had a
good free road to Richmond, where he met with a cordial
welcome from Lee.</p>

<p>The loss of 124 killed and 292 wounded showed the
disposition of Carroll's Brigade to fight, as also the
character of the rebel fire, and the 514 prisoners testified
to the character of the pursuit in getting Carroll
out of the way.</p>

<p>Ewell was liberal enough to concede three Confederates
to one National, in number, and voluntarily said,
"It was a most gallant fight on the part of the latter."</p>

<p>The Regiment lost one man killed and ten wounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th, Shields' Division reached Luray, and
on the</p>

<p>15th, was again at Front Royal.</p>

<p>On the 18th, at Manassas Junction, and on the</p>

<p>25th, arrived at Camp Pope, near Alexandria.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">"<span class="smcap">Army of Virginia.</span>"</p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 26th, by order of the President, the forces
under Fremont, Banks, and McDowell were constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the "Army of Virginia," Pope in command, Fremont
assigned to the 1st Corps, Banks the 2d, and McDowell
the 3d. Fremont withdrew from the Service because
thus made subordinate to an officer whose commission
post-dated his own.</p>

<p>The career of Shields' Division, as such, was now
ended, the 1st and 2d Brigades being sent to McClellan
on the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Carroll's Brigade was now to be a part of Ricketts'
Division, McDowell's Corps.</p>

<p class="p2">A glance at the map, with a view to locating the
places to which reference has been made by name, will
make clear the importance of the work in which the
84th was engaged thus early in its career.</p>

<p>It will also make plain that all of danger to Washington
did not lie across the Long Bridge.</p>

<p>Length of consideration is not needed to incline to
the opinion that Jackson in Maryland and Pennsylvania,
in the early days of '62, would have produced a
feeling throughout the North not calculated to lessen
the weight of the conflict.</p>

<p>Operations by other troops in the eastern part of
Virginia would have been impossible had Jackson
overcome the forces in the Valley. Against him
Shields' Division played an effective part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Shields' Division, and not the "other fellows,"
that Jackson's men least desired to meet.</p>

<p>At the time of McClellan's Peninsula campaign, the
people did not understand the situation about Winchester
and other points in the Valley, and have not cared
to learn it since.</p>

<p>It was well for Pennsylvania, it was well for the
Union, that the fiat against Shields had not gone forth
before June of '62. He was the first to strike Jackson
with defeat, and no one did it afterward.</p>

<p>This noble Division of Shields' marched promptly
and fought well, and therein they had, and have, their
compensation, without being sung in lines of rhyme, or
spoken in the pages of story.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 21st of June, Samuel M. Bowman, late Major
4th Illinois Cavalry, was commissioned, and on the
25th mustered, Colonel of the 84th.</p>

<p>Major Barrett was promoted to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy,
McDowell having been discharged for disability,
in July.</p>

<p>And Adjutant Craig was promoted to the Majority.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Details for Recruiting.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Immediately upon his arrival at the Regiment, Colonel
Bowman determined to add to the effective strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the Command by sending recruiting parties to
several localities in Pennsylvania, and also by securing
the active interest of citizens of the State who were
not then in the Service.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Pope's Campaign.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">While at Camp Pope the requisite details were made,
and while numbers at home were thus being added to
the rolls, the Regiment continued its active service in
the field, marching out from Camp Pope, in July, to
join Pope's Army, which was always to "look before,
and not behind," and which was to "subsist upon the
country in which their operations were carried on."</p>

<p>While McClellan was moving against the Capital of
the Confederacy, it was Pope's part to keep secure the
Capital of the Union.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Cedar Mountain.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On August 9th, was fought the Battle of Cedar
Mountain, in which the 84th was not directly engaged,
excepting as a reserve force. The official record gives
one officer and eight men wounded from the rebel fire
of shot and shell after dark.</p>

<p>Following upon the battle the rebel force, numbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
about 25,000, retreated across the Rapidan, Pope
pursuing and occupying the north side of the river.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Arrival of "H" Co.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">While at this point, the Regiment, for the first time,
placed ten companies in line. "H" Co. had been
recruited during the Spring and early Summer, and
left Camp Curtin, under orders to join the Regiment,
on the 14th, arriving on the 16th.</p>

<p class="p2">Pope did not remain in this position long.</p>

<p>At this period of the War it was looked upon at the
North as the worst of generalship to permit any rebel
troops to get between our forces and the Seat of Government,
and it was well known on the other side that
any movement that threatened such a condition would
cause the quick packing of tents and the immediate
tramp of whatever Union force was charged with the
protection of the Capital. Later on came a change in
this regard.</p>

<p>Jackson threatened Washington by starting a movement
to Pope's rear, passing around his right flank.</p>

<p>On the 19th, commenced Pope's backward march.</p>

<p>On the 21st, Pope was safely across the Rappahannock,
and immediately Jackson was along the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
side of the river. Rappahannock Station was the central
river point, the line stretching 15 miles.</p>

<p>In '62, an ordinary river stemmed the current of
pursuit more effectually than it did in '64.</p>

<p>On the 22d, the rebel cavalry struck Catlett Station,
and on the</p>

<p>23d, the bridge across the Rappahannock was burned,
and the station abandoned by Pope.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Thoroughfare Gap.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 28th, Ricketts' Division was at Thoroughfare
Gap, sent there to check the advance of Longstreet's
Corps on its way to join Jackson at Manassas.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that McClellan's failure in front of
Richmond had become fixed fact before this movement
of Jackson's was determined upon, and now Lee's
troops at Richmond were relieved from pressure.</p>

<p>The march to the Gap was too late for effective
service, and, on the same night, Ricketts marched his
Division from Thoroughfare Gap to join the main
army.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Second Bull Run.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 29th, the Regiment, with the Division, was
on the right flank of the Army, at Groveton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th, the second day of the
battle, the Regiment was exposed to a severe fire of
grape and canister.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Ricketts' Division was attacked by
the enemy with masses of troops, but held its part well
until ordered back by Pope about 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, after the final
break along the Union line.</p>

<p>From that part of the line which had been so successfully
held during the latter half of the day, and
night being yet an hour off, there was afforded a clear
view of flying Artillery and flying Infantry, all moving
to a common center&mdash;Centerville.</p>

<p>While it was not strictly a walk, yet, in view of the
situation, in good order the Regiment went back about
a mile and took position, with other Regiments of the
Brigade, in an open field, in fact facing the enemy, yet
not knowing whom we faced. Here occurred the incident
which almost (a minute of time made the difference)
disposed of the 84th.</p>

<p>Just daylight enough left to discern a line, a full
brigade front, advancing, yet not enough to distinguish
the color of the uniform, or to make sure the flag.</p>

<p>On they came, a perfect line, marching as if on
review. "Who are you?" thrice repeated, brought no
response. Not a word was spoken in their ranks, but
on they came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes before, Lieutenant Nixon had been
ordered to post a detail of pickets, but had not had
time to go out. "I will learn who they are," said
Nixon. Twenty-five steps to the front, and he was half
way. Then came from him the words which seem to
sound upon my ear every time the incident occurs to
me, "They are the enemy, boys!" And then, for it
was dark now, upon the instant was seen that flash of
light along the whole line of that rebel brigade. I see
it now as I saw it then. With the flash came the
whirr of the thousands of bullets, but the darkness in
the aim saved the objects for which they were intended.</p>

<p>The fire was the vengeance of the failure to capture.</p>

<p>Night being fully on, our small force had accomplished
all that it had been left on the field for&mdash;the
checking of pursuit&mdash;and was now not long in getting
to the Centerville side of Bull Run.</p>

<p>On the night of September 1st, the Regiment was at
Fairfax Station.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Arlington Heights.&mdash;Arrival of Recruits.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On September 2d, back to the defences of Washington,
a part of the 2d Brigade, 3d Division, 3d Corps.
At first in camp at Alexandria. Then a long march on
the Virginia side, across the Potomac, on through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Georgetown, and back, locating on Arlington Heights,
where the Regiment awaited the 350 recruits, the outcome
of Colonel Bowman's efforts inaugurated at Camp
Pope.</p>

<p>Some were received in small detachments, others as
organized companies, places being provided by the consolidation
of old companies, or as partial organizations,
and placed with old companies. This was the more
readily accomplished, owing to the retirement of many
of the old line officers.</p>

<p>Of the 27 Line Officers mustered in with the Regiment,
2, Gallagher and Reem, had been killed, 20 had
resigned before the end of 1862, leaving only 5&mdash;Bryan,
Opp, Zinn, Peterman and Ingram.</p>

<p>Of the original Field Officers, Murray only had done
active service, and he had been killed. MacDowell,
Lieutenant-Colonel, had been discharged for disability,
in July. Barrett had been promoted Lieutenant-Colonel,
and resigned in September. Adjutant Craig had
been promoted Major and Lieutenant-Colonel, and
resigned.</p>

<p>None of the Field Officers left, the Adjutant gone,
and not one of the original Captains of companies
remaining.</p>

<p>Of the five Line Officers remaining, Opp, Bryan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Ingram had entered the service as First Lieutenants,
and Zinn and Peterman as Second Lieutenants.</p>

<p>Opp obtained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, in
command of the Regiment, and was mortally wounded
at the Wilderness. Bryan became Major, and Zinn
rose to the rank of Colonel, with the Brevet of Brigadier-General.
Peterman became Captain and was
killed at Chancellorsville. Ingram resigned in the
early part of 1863.</p>

<p>Of all the original Officers, Field, Staff and Line,
only two, Zinn and Bryan, served with the Regiment
until the close of the War, and they are still among us.</p>

<p>Of the after Line Officers, 32 were promotions from
the ranks, and also two of the three Adjutants.</p>

<p>Fribley to Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant and
Captain of the 84th, and Colonel 8th U. S. Colored
Troops.</p>

<p>Dougherty, Steinman, Farley, Nixon, Sampson and
Rissel, to Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant and
Captain.</p>

<p>Delehunt and Lamberton, to Second Lieutenant and
Captain.</p>

<p>Thornton to First Lieutenant and Captain.</p>

<p>Mather to Adjutant.</p>

<p>Merchant to Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant
and Adjutant, with the Brevet of Captain.</p>

to Second Lieutenant and First Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Gwinn, Wingate, Piper, Moore, Hays, McMaster,
Wolf, Hursh, Wilson, Weidensall and Davidson, to
Second Lieutenant.</p>

<p>As newly organized, "C" Co. was consolidated with
A, and the new Company from Westmoreland County,
Captain Logan and Lieutenant Wirsing, took the place
of the original C Co.</p>

<p>B Co. received recruits under Lieutenant Young.</p>

<p>D Co. received recruits under Lieutenant Hunter.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Zinn, B Co., was commissioned Captain
of D.</p>

<p>A Company of about 70 men, under Captain Dobbins
and Lieutenant Johnson, was added to E, Lieutenant
Steinman, of the old organization, remaining.</p>

<p>F Co. was added to by recruits under Lieutenant
Forrester.</p>

<p>G Co. received recruits under Captain Platt and
Lieutenant Brindle.</p>

<p>H Co. received recruits under Lieutenant Jackson.</p>

<p>Many of the old men of I Co. were transferred to K,
and I Co. reorganized by a large detachment under
Captain Comfort and Lieutenant Ross.</p>

<p>K Co. was materially strengthened by the transfers
from I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Assigned to Whipple's Division.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">In the latter part of October, the Regiment left its
camp at Arlington Heights, and joined the Army
under McClellan at Berlin, still constituting a part of
Carroll's Brigade, which had been assigned to Whipple's
Independent Division.</p>

<p>On November 7th, by order from the War Department,
McClellan was relieved from the command of the
Army of the Potomac, and succeeded by Major-General
Burnside.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">At Falmouth.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On November 17th, the advance of the Army
arrived at Falmouth, opposite Fredericksburg, and
again the whole Army was confronting Lee.</p>

<p>On December 11th, Fredericksburg was subjected to
a heavy artillery fire, to cover the laying of a Pontoon
bridge.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Fredericksburg.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought on the
13th, the rebel troops having been forced out of the
town to their fortifications on the Heights in the rear.</p>

<p>The Regiment was severely engaged. General Griffin
called on Whipple for Carroll's Brigade, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
promptly moved up through the town under fire of
shot and shell. Stopping in a cut of the Richmond
Railroad, then climbing the steep embankment, the
Brigade rushed on and was soon at the very front. Two
Companies went on in advance of the line of battle and
had to be recalled. During the night the enemy
attempted to force the part of the line occupied by the
84th and 110th Pa., but was repulsed.</p>

<p>7 men killed and 24 wounded.</p>

<p>Colonel Bowman, 84th, and Lieutenant Crowther,
110th, were specially mentioned in the Brigade Commander's
report.</p>

<p>After the battle, the Regiment went into Camp at
Stoneman's Switch, on the Falmouth and Acquia Creek
Railroad, about 2 miles from Falmouth.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on the 1st of October, 1862, Captain
Opp had been promoted Major, and, on December
23d, Lieutenant-Colonel, Barrett and Craig having both
resigned.</p>

<p>Captain Zinn was promoted Major, October 2d.</p>

<p>On January 18th, 1863, Sergeant Mather, B Co.,
was promoted Adjutant.</p>

<p>On January 19th, Burnside started the Army for a
second attempt on Fredericksburg, but the heavy rain
converted the movement into a "Mud March," and it
was abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The outcome of December 13th and January 19th,
was the removal of Burnside, on January 26th, from
the command of the Army, and the substitution of
Major-General Hooker.</p>

<p>These were experimental days, and rotation in office
of Corps and Army Commanders largely practised, but
the experiments were harsh indeed to the boys who did
the tramping and the fighting.</p>

<p>On February 5th, by order of General Hooker, the
Army of the Potomac was reorganized, and Reynolds
assigned to the command of the 1st Corps; Couch, the
2d; Sickles, the 3d; Meade, the 5th; Sedgwick, the 6th;
Sigel, the 11th; and Slocum, the 12th; the Cavalry
under Stoneman.</p>

<p>The 84th and 110th Pa. and 12th New Hampshire,
constituted the 2d Brigade, 3d Division, 3d Corps, with
Bowman Commanding. Lieutenant-Colonel Opp in
command of the Regiment.</p>

<p>Picketing along the Rappahannock, by details of
Regiments, was the principal duty from January to</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Chancellorsville.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">April 29th, when the Army broke camp and started
on a campaign intended to be brief, but sharp and
decisive, fruitful of great and important results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Hooker's plan, most intelligently conceived
and thorough in its details. Without Jackson on the
other side, it would have gone down in history as the
battle of the War, and Hooker would have been the
Lieutenant-General. No rebel army would thereafter
have crossed the Potomac to make a Gettysburg. The
Gettysburg of the War would have been on Southern
soil.</p>

<p>The Regiment participated in the feint to the left of
Fredericksburg, and on the</p>

<p>1st of May, moved toward Chancellorsville, the place
of the campaign, crossing the Rappahannock at United
States Ford.</p>

<p>On the 2d, late in the afternoon, Sickles was ordered
to send two Divisions, the 2d and 3d, in the direction
of the Old Furnace, to cut off the march of rebel
troops toward the right of our line. Jackson, however,
as was his custom, had already passed by and out of
the way, excepting a regiment, which was captured.</p>

<p>While two-thirds of Sickles' Corps was in this
exposed position, Jackson literally fell on the 11th
Corps, away to the right of the Union line, at a time
when the whole of that Corps was lying in supposed
security, doubled it up, and in this way substituted the
Field plan of Lee for the Camp study of Hooker; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Chancellorsville was become a ground to fight on but
not a place of victory.</p>

<p>In the words of that memorable Order, the "Enemy
was in a bag." But where was the string?</p>

<p>However, there was virtue in the situation, in that it
furnished the grandest test that could have been presented
to the Army of the Potomac. Most fully
defeated, yet not alarmed. Line broken, yet not
pursued.</p>

<p>Hooker's Army was a body of positive soldiery, who
knew not on that 2d of May, nor until well back on
sure ground, how nearly Lee had gained what Hooker
started out to accomplish.</p>

<p>Back from the Old Furnace came the two Divisions
of Sickles', while Keenan, with his Battalion of
Cavalry, held the whole rebel force, to make time for
the planting of the guns, and lessen the time for the
falling of the night, which was to be the safeguard of
our Army.</p>

<p>The next morning found our Brigade too far out,
and where it would not have remained through the
night had its position and number been known to the
occupants of the woods along the line of which it was
posted.</p>

<p>The Brigade was drawn back in the direction of the
Chancellor House, and put behind a short line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
light breast-works, in an isolated position, without any
support to the right or left. We had been closely followed
in our withdrawal of the morning, and were now
hard pressed by the enemy forcing in upon our front,
while a large force could be seen moving some distance
on our left, which, within a half-hour, coming through
the woods and over the rise to our rear, were immediately
at our back before their coming was known.</p>

<p>For some time, such of the Union troops as could be
seen from the position occupied by the Regiment, had
been giving way and falling back to the protection of
the numerous guns posted in front of the Chancellor
House, and which had not yet opened fire.</p>

<p>The Union line did not seem to be holding anywhere.</p>

<p>The killed and wounded of the Regiment had been
added to at every fire.</p>

<p>Pressed to the front and rear by forces too large to
contend with, with one flank closed and the other
nearly so, it was now only the question of escape, or
capture.</p>

<p>When the colors of the Regiment were planted
behind the inner works, twice the fingers of the hands
counted the total of the officers and men who stood
with them.</p>

<p>Out of 391, 1 officer, Peterman, then Captain of K<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Co., and 5 men had been killed; 5 officers and 54 men
wounded, and 154 captured and missing.</p>

<p>General Whipple was killed just to the right of the
Regiment, on the 4th.</p>

<p>On the night of the 4th, rain came down in a flood,
so that the Rappahannock was much swollen. About
midnight, Hooker's Army commenced crossing to the
North side, and, by the night of the 5th, all were back
on the old camp ground.</p>

<p>Many of the dead had been left on the field where
they fell, and many of the wounded left to rebel care.
Death had come to some of the wounded from the fire
in the woods, caused by the shelling on the 3d. The
great loss to the rebel side came a few days after, in the
death of Jackson, who had been mortally wounded on
the night of the 2d.</p>

<p>Following on Chancellorsville, owing to the death of
Whipple and the numerous casualties, the Division was
broken up and the regiments assigned to other commands.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Parted from the 110th.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The 84th and 110th had been together up to this
time, but from now on were to be parted. The 84th
went to the 1st Brigade (Carr's), 2d Division (Humphrey's),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and the 110th to the 3d Brigade, 1st
Division.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Gettysburg Campaign.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">In the early part of June, it became clear that the
officials of the confederacy were so much encouraged by
the result of Hooker's campaign, that they had determined
upon sending Lee into Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A reconnoissance by the Cavalry under Buford and
Gregg, south of the Rappahannock, delayed Lee for a
few days.</p>

<p>As soon as it was known that Lee was on the way,
the people of Pennsylvania felt what the consequence
<i>could</i> be, and feared what it <i>might</i> be. The State was
divided into two Military Districts. The Department
of the Monongahela, west of the Laurel Ridge Mountains,
was commanded by General Brooks, Headquarters,
Pittsburg; and the Department of the Susquehanna
by General Couch, Headquarters, Chambersburg.</p>

<p>On June 14th, Milroy was forced out of Winchester,
leaving behind siege guns, 8 field pieces, 6000 muskets,
ammunition and stores.</p>

<p>June 15th, the President called on Maryland and
West Virginia for 10,000 militia, each; Ohio for 30,000,
and Pennsylvania for 50,000, for six months' service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>June 16th, Jenkins' rebel cavalry, 950 strong, occupied
Chambersburg, and withdrew on the 18th.</p>

<p>19th, portion of Rhodes' rebel cavalry entered
McConnelsburg and sacked the town.</p>

<p>21st, Pleasanton drove Stuart beyond Middletown,
through Upperville and Ashby's Gap.</p>

<p>23d, rebel forces again occupied Chambersburg, the
Union troops in the town falling back.</p>

<p>26th, rebel advance reached Carlisle, the militia
under General Knipe retiring.</p>

<p class="p2">Lee's forces were well under way down the Valley,
when Hooker took down his tents opposite Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>From the start to the finish it was a race, but not
from the foe. There were no obstacles worth the mention
for Lee to encounter, none for Hooker.</p>

<p>Lee went upon that side of the mountain, Hooker
upon this. Across the Potomac went Lee, and across
the Potomac came Hooker&mdash;at different points.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac had marched before, but
never before, nor after, as it did through the night after
crossing into Maryland. Along the tow-path, dark,
wet and slippery; strength all gone, and the muscles
expanding simply to get rid of the contraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the character of the march, that at times
the nearest comrade on the walk would not be within
ten paces to the front or rear.</p>

<p>What had been lost at the start must now be made
up, for Lee was well on toward every Pennsylvania
soldier's home.</p>

<p>On June 27th, at Frederick, Maryland, the order
was promulgated assigning Major-General Meade to the
command of the Army of the Potomac, and Hooker
thereby relieved.</p>

<p>On the night of June 30th, at Taneytown, came the
order detailing the Regiment to guard the Supply
Train.</p>

<p>The next morning, Colonel Opp, knowing that his
men were averse to such duty, made special request of
the Brigade Commander to revoke the order, but without
success.</p>

<p>July 1st, started with the train, which was then moving
with the Column from Taneytown on the road to
Emmettsburg, and while on the way word came that
the Cavalry and the 1st Corps had encountered Lee at
Gettysburg, and that Reynolds had been killed.</p>

<p>Immediately following this announcement came the
order for the Supply Trains to report at Westminster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The Supply Trains were an important factor in
army organization. They did good service in the
camp, along the march, and on the field. Without
them even Gettysburg would not have been a Field of
Monuments. At least twenty regiments of the Army
of the Potomac did guard duty with the trains on the
1st, 2d, and 3d of July, 1863. That duty was quite
as necessary of performance, fully as important, carrying
with it as much of possible danger, as was actually
encountered by regiments engaged on the field, and as
much of actual danger as did not fall to the lot of
several of the regiments who were no more on the field
than were the troops with the trains, and which regiments
wrote Gettysburg on their battle flags without a
question as to its being rightly there.</p>

<p>When the State of Pennsylvania placed upon her
Statute Books the Act that gave to every Pennsylvania
Command having a part in the Battle of Gettysburg a
Memorial Stone, I had no doubt as to the 84th coming
within the terms of the Act, and no doubt as to the
duty of its Soldiers to see that its Monument was
placed.</p>

<p>The Regiment had been, from the time of its entry
into the service, a part of the Army of the Potomac,
even before all the troops in Virginia were so designated,
and continued to be till the end of the War. Failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of recognition under this Law of the Commonwealth,
as a part of the Army of the Potomac, would have left
the Regiment unrecorded to the world as of any army
up to and including the time of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>But comment of our own is unnecessary. The statement
of General Carr, the Brigade Commander, covers
all points, and coming from an individual thoroughly
competent to pass judgment, and yet free from the
slightest degree of interest that might possibly induce
bias, ought to, and does, answer all question and resolve
all doubt.</p>

<p>(The following letter was written by General Carr
in response to a communication asking simply for a
statement by him of the duty on which the Regiment
was ordered in connection with the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The tribute thus tendered to the Regiment not only
evidences the high regard had by General Carr for the
officers and men of the 84th, but is indicative of the
feeling entertained and expressed by Shields, Carroll,
Ricketts, Whipple, Pierce, Mott, and other General
Officers, in whose immediate command the Regiment
was placed between October, '61, and July, '65.)</p>

</div>

<p class="pbq p1">Sir:&mdash;I have the honor to present the following statement, in
reference to the part taken by the 84th Regiment Pennsylvania
Volunteers in the Gettysburg Campaign.</p>

<p class="pbq">The 84th Regiment was in the 1st Brigade, 2d Division, 3d
Corps, Army of the Potomac, during the movements of that
Army from Fredericksburg, Va., to Emmettsburg, Md. On the
morning of the 1st July, the Regiment was detailed by an order
from my headquarters to guard the supply train that was then
located between Emmettsburg and Gettysburg. The Regiment
remained on duty with the train until relieved by another
Regiment on the 6th July, when it reported to me for duty
while at Williamsport.</p>

<p class="pbq">The duty performed by the 84th Regiment during the three
days' fighting was as essential and important as that of any
other Regiment of my command; it was a duty they were
ordered to perform over which they had no control, but as good
soldiers obeyed the command. When Colonel Opp received
the order he sent his Adjutant, Lieutenant Mather, to me with
a request to have the order rescinded, which of course was not
granted.</p>

<p class="pbq">The 84th Regiment was one of my best and most reliable
commands. The officers and men were always ready and
willing to do their duty.</p>

<p class="pbq">To deprive this Regiment of the recognition it is entitled to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
upon that memorable battle field, would in my opinion be a
very great injustice.</p>

<p class="pbq">I would respectfully suggest that the monument be erected at
a point near where my headquarters were previous to the second
day's engagement. It was near the Emmettsburg road, directly
in front of the Roger's house, as you will see upon the map of
the field.</p>

<p class="pbq">The inscription should state the whereabouts of the Regiment
on the 1st, 2d and 3d of July, 1863, and the actual duty it was
performing.</p>

<p class="pn20 reduct p1">I am, Very Respectfully,</p>
<p class="pn40 reduct">JOSEPH B. CARR.</p>


<p class="p1">This statement is a Monument in itself. No Regiment
ever received, or could have had, more emphatic
endorsement of its service.</p>

<p>The State Commission on Gettysburg Monuments
had no doubt of the full right of the 84th to participate
with all other Pennsylvania regiments that took part
in the Battle of Gettysburg, and promptly said so.</p>

<p>On the night of the 4th, the Regiment was ordered
from Westminster to rejoin the Brigade, and reported
to General Carr on the 6th.</p>

<p>While at Westminster there was constant apprehension
of attack by rebel cavalry, and the picket guards
were under strict orders to be continually on the alert
to avoid surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night of the 13th and the morning of
the 14th, Lee crossed his army over the Potomac at
Williamsport, closely followed by the Union cavalry,
the advance of the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>On July 24th, the Regiment took part in clearing
the Gap at Wapping Heights, the rebels contesting
every step until forced into the Valley, when they went
on a run, and we returned through the Gap to rejoin
the column.</p>

<p>The return was much like the going, excepting that
there was not the necessity for haste, and with this difference
of feeling. The rebel army had started North
elated by Chancellorsville; it returned depressed by
Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The Union Army had not been depressed by Chancellorsville
(it never was by any defeat), but was more
than pleased with Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The walk did not stop until the Army of the
Potomac was again between the Rappahannock and
the Rapidan.</p>

<p class="p2">July, August, and September having passed by, and
October being well under way, Lee, having nothing to
gain by remaining quiet, again put his army in motion,
this time bound for the road that led to his Country's
Capital, but not with patriotic intent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the Army of the Potomac had become
well grounded in the ups and downs which lie between
the Rapidan and the Potomac.</p>

<p>Foraging had become a thing of the past in this now
agricultural and animal forsaken portion of our Land.
In fact, at the time when anything was to be found
here, it was not permitted to be taken. It was not
until later on that the conclusion was arrived at that
Union Armies were not organized and maintained to
guard crops for rebel army use and the sustenance of
a southern confederacy.</p>

<p>Thousands of Union Soldiers might lie in unknown
graves, and tens of thousands might be sent home
cripples for life, but not an ear on the stalk, or a grain
in the crib, an animal on the hoof, or his parts in the
smoke-house, must be taken by the Union Soldier, lest
treason might not have abundance.</p>

<p>All that was left of what once had been, were the
names of the places along the route&mdash;Rappahannock
Station, Catlett, Bristoe, Manassas, Thoroughfare, Haymarket,
Union Mills.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Lee's Last Move on Washington.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Meade became aware of Lee's purpose too late to
make the following a walk, or even an easy run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so closely parallel, at times, that it was not
certain which army was in the pursuit, and when at
Bristoe Station,</p>

<p>On October 14th, the 2d Corps and a portion of the
5th were attacked, while marching by the flank, by a portion
of Hill's Corps under Heth, Warren did a service
for the Army of the Potomac, and his Country, which
should have avoided the decree of April, 1865, removing
him from his Command.</p>

<p>It was the only Infantry engagement of moment in
the movement, and had the effect of making this the
last in the series of Lee's running campaigns on Washington.</p>

<p>On his way back, starting on the</p>

<p>19th, Lee destroyed the Railroad, which Meade
rebuilt as the Army of the Potomac advanced leisurely
to the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>On November 7th, Meade forded the river at Rappahannock
Station and Kelly's Ford, the battling at both
points being severe, and the Army of the Potomac <i>no
more came back until without a foe</i>.</p>

<p>November 8th, Lee crossed the Rapidan, <i>and he
never came back</i>.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Camp at Brandy Station.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Meade's Army went into camp, the 84th to the left
of Brandy Station, on land of John Minor Botts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
immediately commenced the erection of Winter quarters.</p>

<p>Picket duty and the ordinary engagements of the
camp followed, until</p>

<p>November 25th, when the Army marched the few
miles to the Rapidan, crossed over, and the rebels fell
back, contesting all the way, until Locust Grove was
reached on the</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Locust Grove or Mine Run.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">27th, where the Regiment was warmly engaged.
Here occurred the incident which clearly proved the
fastness of the colors of the 84th.</p>

<p>The whole line to the right and left gave way. This
forced the Regiment to retire, and there was every
indication of a precipitate retreat. The Regiment had
gone but its flags were still there. The Adjutant came
promptly to the direction of the Colors, and the two
flags in the hands of the Bearers, supported by the
Color Guard, marched off the field to the ordinary step,
and in as orderly manner as when passing from the
Parade Ground to Headquarters. The flags might have
been captured, and the Adjutant and Guard with them,
but it would have been a capture to which no discredit
would have attached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>1 officer and 8 men wounded.</p>

<p>From the field of Locust Grove to Mine Run, and a
sight of the defences of Lee.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Contemplated Charge at Mine Run.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the night of the 28th, orders were given to charge
the enemy's works the next morning at 8 o'clock, and
by daylight the Army was in line, awaiting the order
to advance. It was well the order of execution was not
given. The slaughter that would have ensued would
have been without its fellow in the tales of the War.</p>

<p>Pickett at Gettysburg was a thing of Parade compared
with what this would have been.</p>

<p>The troops would have gone over a space which
thereafter would have been noted as the Field of Death.</p>

<p>Meade thought one way; Warren the other.</p>

<p>Warren was right, and Meade saw, in time, that he,
himself, was wrong.</p>

<p><i>This act of Warren did not call for what was done
him at Five Forks.</i></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Back at Brandy Station.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The day passed, and in the night, the pickets cautioned
to keep the fires going and then left to take care
of themselves, Meade had his Army quietly slip away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from out of sight of the defences they had only looked
upon, and then, without hurry, back to the old camp at
Brandy Station, where from the 2d of December, 1863,
to May 3d, 1864, the camp life of Winter was unbroken,
save for a day or two, taken up by the march to the
Rapidan on February 6th, as a caution to Lee, who was
somewhat restless to learn what the Army in front of
him was doing.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Veteran Re-Enlistments.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Also the re-enlistments for the Veteran three years,
accompanied by the furlough for thirty days.</p>

<p>But during this time there occurred what was to
subject all elements of all the Armies of the Union to
harmony of action, and thus, in good time, end the
attempt at the destruction of the Union, and thereby
cease the struggle for its maintenance.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Grant in Command of all the Armies.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">By special Act of Congress the rank of Lieutenant-General
was revived, and, by the President, conferred
on Major-General Ulysses S. Grant, with assignment
to the command of all the Armies of the United States,
Halleck being relieved as General-in-Chief, and assigned
to duty in Washington as Army Chief of Staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>After the severe experiences of three years, the
Executive and Legislative Departments had come to
the common agreement, that the rebellion could be put
down with one Army, but never with a score, with ten,
nor even two. Starting anew, there would be one
Captain of the Host.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac was now&mdash;2d Corps,
Hancock; 5th Corps, Warren; 6th Corps, Sedgwick;
Cavalry, Sheridan; and Hunt, Chief of Artillery;
Meade in command of the whole, but Grant always
present.</p>

<p>The 84th was assigned to the 2d Brigade, 4th
Division (Mott), 2d Corps (Hancock), and from this
on the references to the 2d Corps will be, mainly, our
account of the 84th.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Grant's Campaign.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Soon after midnight,</p>

<p>May 3-4, '64, was inaugurated Grant's Campaign&mdash;the
longest, but the last, of the War.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac moved off their five
months' camping ground, thereafter to realize that
armies could move without regard to seasons.</p>

<p>Pontoons were thrown across the Rapidan, principally
at Germania and Ely's Fords.</p>

<p>Passed over the battle ground of just a year before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
at Chancellorsville, and came well into the Wilderness
on the</p>

<p>5th. At 9 o'clock, Hancock was ordered to the
support of Getty's Division, the 2d of the 6th Corps,
who had run against the enemy on the Orange Plank
and Turnpike Roads.</p>

<p>The woods and narrow roads prevented Hancock
from getting into position until 4 o'clock, when he sent
Birney's and Mott's Divisions to Getty's support, and
saved him from a rout.</p>

<p>Fighting continued until dark.</p>

<p>Grant's disposition of the troops placed Hancock in
command of about one-half the Line, and thus located,
he was ordered to attack at 4 o'clock the morning of
the 6th, subsequently changed, at Meade's suggestion,
to 5 o'clock. The movement was prompt, and to the
left of the Orange Plank Road.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of the Wilderness.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">By the end of the first hour of the desperate fighting
of that morning, it was Grant's belief, that "if the
country had been such that Hancock and his Command
could have seen the confusion and panic in the lines of
the enemy, it would have been taken advantage of so
effectually, that Lee would not have made another
stand outside the Richmond defences."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy got close upon a portion of the 2d Corps
before being seen, owing to the density of the woods,
and they were so suddenly forced back as to compel the
retirement of Mott's Division also to the intrenched
position of the morning.</p>

<p>The Battle was kept up from 5 o'clock in the morning
until night, and all the time within a width of
space averaging not over three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<p>During the night all of Lee's army withdrew within
their intrenchments.</p>

<p>Grant said "that more desperate fighting had not
been witnessed on this Continent, than that of the 5th
and 6th of May."</p>

<p>The 84th was in the very thick of the fight. 9 men
killed, 2 officers and 39 men wounded.</p>

<p>The character of this fighting ground is a thing of
history. Heavy timber, close, thick underbrush, impossibility
of knowing where the enemy was until close at
hand, the burning breast-works, all present factors in
the fight, gave Grant to know that he had an Army on
whom he could rely for the very best of service.</p>

<p>Grant had the faith before he had applied the test,
for on the 5th all the bridges over the Rapidan had
been taken up, except the one at Germania Ford, showing
that he had no thought of necessity for recrossing
the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Death of Col. Opp.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Among the wounded of the 84th was its Commander,
Lieutenant-Colonel Opp, shot through the lung. He
suffered, and how bravely, until the 9th, when he died.
And it but honors every soldier of the Regiment, from
the highest in rank to the lowest, when it is said, that
with his going out there was made a vacancy in the
Regimental household, which we have felt from then to
the present, and will ever feel, until we greet him in
our Reunion when we gather together in that other
time which shall follow upon this.</p>

<p>In the closing weeks of '62 the Regiment had sought
and found new life, and with the beginning of '63 had
started off anew, cleared of all that might have held it
back in the then coming time. Milton Opp was then
the Second Officer of the Regiment. He was possessed
of an ambition worthy of all the praise that grateful
men could well bestow; ambitious, not for himself, but
for his Regiment. In command from January, 1863,
to the time of his death, the very example of his
manner, his bearing, whether with belt on or off, was
such, as to bring up the tone of every soldier of the
84th. The lowest in the Regiment was higher, the
highest was higher, because of the presence of Milton
Opp. No Regimental Headquarters surpassed his in
integrity of purpose, firmness without severity of action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
or sense of duty in everything that was calculated to
incline a Regiment of soldiers to be a credit to themselves,
and an honor to their State.</p>

<p>How much the situation did for the general tone of
the Regiment has, perhaps, been more thought of since
than during the time of its service.</p>

<p>Aided from the beginning by a most faithful and
altogether most competent Adjutant, Colonel Opp
brought the Regiment up to a standard of discipline
from which his successors in command never saw it
depart, from which, good and able officers that they
were, they would not have permitted it to depart.
Between their task and his, and it detracts not one whit
from them to think it or to say it, there was this difference;
he made it the easier for them to carry out well,
as they faithfully did, what he had so well provided.
He was the most loved by those whose acquaintance
with him was the most intimate. A gentleman, a
Christian, a man.</p>

<p>How we would all welcome him, could we greet him
now. And by none would he have been welcomed
among us with more of good, earnest feeling, than by
him who so well succeeded to the Command which was
left by Milton Opp on the 6th of May, 1864.</p>

<p class="p2">The Battle of the Wilderness had been fought. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac learned that a
drawn battle could be made in its results a great
victory, when they learned that Grant not only commanded
the masses of the troops, but had firm control
of the official elements, and 48 hours was sufficient for
the lesson, is it any wonder that "the greatest enthusiasm
was manifested by Hancock's troops," when, on
the 7th of May, Grant rode behind the 2d Corps, lying
on the Brock Road, "inspired," says Grant, "no doubt
by the fact that the movement was South."</p>

<p>No more exhibitions of jealousy among Commanders
of Corps. Such conduct was now to send a Major-General
to the rear as a useless incumbrance.</p>

<p class="p2">Early on the morning of the 7th, Grant's order had
gone out for a night march to Spottsylvania.</p>

<p>An encounter with Early detained the 2d Corps at
Todd's Tavern, and kept it from Spottsylvania on
the 8th.</p>

<p>Having got rid of Early, at noon on the 9th Hancock
was ordered up from Todd's Tavern, excepting
Mott's Division, which followed later in the day.</p>

<p>Sedgwick, commanding the 6th Corps, was killed on
the morning of the 9th, by a rebel sharpshooter.</p>

<p>On the 10th, Hancock was ordered to attack with
the 2d, 5th and 6th Corps. The assault was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, with not altogether
satisfactory result. Mott's Division was on the left of
the 6th Corps.</p>

<p>On the 11th, the only movement was by Mott's
Division, acting under orders to develop a weak spot in
the enemy's line. The outcome of this reconnoissance
was Grant's order of the 11th, for an assault at precisely
4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> of the 12th, "with all possible vigor, the
preparations to be conducted with the utmost secrecy,
and veiled entirely from the enemy."</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Spottsylvania.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The heavy fog delayed the start one hour.</p>

<p>The objective point was the salient, where, after the
conflict, lay Lee's soldiers piled one upon another, just
as they fell.</p>

<p>The rebel captured numbered 4000, among them
Major-General Edward Johnson, Division Commander,
and Brigadier-General Stewart, commanding a Brigade;
a score of guns, with horses, caissons and ammunition,
and several thousand small arms.</p>

<p>Loss to the Regiment, 9 men killed, 1 officer and 27
men wounded.</p>

<p>It was on May 13th, that Grant in a letter to the
Secretary of War made use of the memorable words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all
Summer."</p>

<p>On the 13th, Grant recommended our old Brigade
Commander, Carroll, for promotion to the rank of
Brigadier-General.</p>

<p>Mott's Division was reduced to a Brigade, and
assigned to Birney's Division.</p>

<p>Whatever further might have been done in pressing
Lee at Spottsylvania, was prevented by the heavy rain
which commenced on the night of the 13th.</p>

<p>On the 18th, Grant gave orders for the movement
by the left flank on to Richmond.</p>

<p>One road from Spottsylvania to Fredericksburg was
now open to Lee, and on the</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Change of Base of Supplies.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">19th, the Base of Supplies was shifted from Fredericksburg
to Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 20th, orders were renewed for the left flank
movement to commence after night.</p>

<p>Hancock, having the lead, marched Easterly to
Guiney's Station, on the Fredericksburg Railroad,
thence Southerly to Bowling Green and Milford, arriving
at Milford on the night of the 21st.</p>

<p>On the 22d, the 2d Corps was permitted to rest
through the day and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">At North Anna River.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">23d, Hancock moved to the Wooden Bridge, West
of the Fredericksburg Railroad Bridge, over the North
Anna River, the rebel guard being intrenched on the
North side. The guard gave way quickly, but so rapid
was the move upon the bridge that several of the rebels
were forced through the water. Owing to the late hour
the Corps did not cross until the next morning.</p>

<p>Regiment had 1 officer and 5 men wounded.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Base of Supplies again Changed.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 26th, Base of Supplies changed from Port
Royal to White House.</p>

<p>All the troops South of the North Anna were crossed
back to the North side, and moved under orders to
proceed to Hanover, a point within 20 miles of Richmond.</p>

<p>On the 29th, at Hanover.</p>

<p>The 2d Corps moved toward Tolopotomy Creek to
discover the whereabouts of the enemy. He was found
strongly fortified.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Tolopotomy.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On May 31st and June 1st, the Regiment was
engaged with the enemy at Pleasant Hill, known as
the Battle of Tolopotomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>4 men killed, 3 officers and 13 men wounded.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Cold Harbor.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">From June 1st to 3d, at Cold Harbor.</p>

<p>1 officer and 6 men wounded.</p>

<p>On June 5th, Grant determined upon moving the
Army South of the James.</p>

<p>On Evening of the 13th, 2d Corps was at Charles
City Court House, on the James River.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Crossing of James River.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 14th, 2d Corps crossed in the advance, using
bridge and boats.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Arrived in Front of Petersburg.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 15th, arrived after dark in front of Petersburg,
and relieved Smith's troops in the trenches.</p>

<p>16th to 18th, continuous fighting.</p>

<p>2 men killed, 3 officers and 11 men wounded.</p>

<p>On the 22d, the 2d Corps was moved to the left to
draw the enemy out, or to compel him to remain within
his lines. He staid in, and now began the Siege of
Petersburg, with the 9th Corps on the Right, then the
5th, 2d Corps next, and then the 6th broken off to
the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The next movement was not until</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Deep Bottom.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">July 26th, when the 2d Corps and the Cavalry
crossed the James River to Deep Bottom, for the purpose
of drawing some of Lee's forces to the North side
of the James, pending the Explosion of the Mine which
had been worked in front of the 9th Corps, commencing
on June 25th, and was now ready to be fired.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the 2d Corps was brought back to the
James, and crossed over at night, with orders to proceed
to that part of the line where the Mine was located.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Explosion of Mine.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The Explosion was in itself a success, but history
records a complete failure in result.</p>

<p>On August 13th and 14th, to keep Lee from sending
troops to the Valley against Sheridan, the 2d Corps,
part of the 10th, and Gregg's Division of Cavalry,
were crossed over the James, with orders not to bring
on a battle.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Charles City Cross Roads.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">It was quite a severe move for the Regiment, an
engagement with the rebels at Charles City Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Roads on the 15th resulting in 2 men killed, 1 officer
and 16 men wounded, and several captured, who suffered
the horrors of Salisbury for many months, some
of them dying for want of food, water and shelter.</p>

<p>On the night of the 20th, withdrew from the North
side of the James River, and Hancock and Gregg sent
Southward to destroy the Weldon Railroad. Ream's
Station fought on the 25th.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Movement to Extreme Left.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">October 1st, moved with the Corps to Yellow House,
and thence to the extreme left of the line. First line
of enemy's works charged and carried.</p>

<p>The Regiment was at this time a part of Pierce's
Brigade, the 2d, Mott's (3d) Division, 2d Corps.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Poplar Spring Church.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the afternoon of the 2d, the 84th, with other
troops, in all not a full regiment in number, with Colonel
Zinn in command of the Charging Party, moved
upon the second line at a point known as Poplar Spring
Church. As soon as the rebel troops became aware of
the purpose to charge, there was the disposition to
abandon their position, but when they saw the small
number of the Charging Party they resumed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
places behind their works, and held their musketry
fire, keeping up the fire of their guns, until the charging
line was within a few feet, when they delivered
such a fire, volley upon volley, as threatened to kill, or
wound, every soldier of the 84th. As we think of that
flood of balls, it seems incredible that none were killed,
and only 8 wounded, 2 officers and 6 men.</p>

<p>Colonel Zinn was shot, and would now be going
around upon one natural leg, had he not successfully
fought the Surgeon's conclusion to take the other off.</p>

<p>October 4th, lay in rear of 9th Corps works, building
forts and slashing timber.</p>

<p>5th, Brigade ordered to join the Corps, and marched
to our old position near Fort Hayes.</p>

<p>6th, Regiment sent to garrison Fort Bross, on Norfolk
and Petersburg Railroad, in company with a Section
of 14th Massachusetts Battery, 2 guns, under Lieutenant
George. No other troops in the vicinity.</p>

<p class="p2">13th, Paymaster on hand with six months' arrears.</p>

<p>October 23d, Three years had now elapsed since the
organization of the Regiment, and the men who had
served during that time, and were not included in the
number of Veteran Enlistments, were honorably discharged
by reason of expiration of term of service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>25th, Regiment ordered to report to Division as soon
as possible. At 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, left Fort Bross, and joined the
Division between the Fort and Jerusalem Plank Road.
Lay massed during the day and night.</p>

<p>26th, Moved to the left, passing the Gurley House,
in rear of our rear line of works. Struck the Weldon
Railroad a mile from the Yellow House. Remained
here until 4 o'clock the next morning, when the march
was continued toward the South Side Railroad, moving
along a narrow road and through woods until we
arrived about 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> near Hatcher's Run and the
Boydton Plank Road.</p>

<p>During the last 5 miles the rebel cavalry continually
engaged our own, working around to our rear as we
advanced, fighting at the Saw Mill shortly after we had
passed.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Battle of Hatcher's Run.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Formed line of battle in open field. A break in the
line to the right, owing to a separation of Divisions,
was promptly noted by the enemy, who marched in by
the flank between Pierce's and McAllister's Brigades,
the latter having been advanced about half a mile to
the front of Mott's Division, until his right rested on
the Boydton Plank Road.</p>

<p>It was an ill advised move on the rebel side. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
soon as noticed by McAllister, he faced his Brigade to
the rear, charged, and took several hundred prisoners.
Pierce's Brigade re-took the two guns which had been
picked up by the enemy at the Plank Road.</p>

<p>The Regiment had 4 men wounded and 1 missing.
6 men were taken prisoners, but escaped.</p>

<p>After dark, threw up light works at right angles with
the Plank Road, being in such position that the shells
from our rear reached where we lay, some going beyond
and others exploding at our line. The enemy was both
to the front and rear, accounted for by the fact that we
were stretching out his extreme right.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, marched back to the old position between
Fort Bross and Jerusalem Plank Road, arriving at 5
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on the 28th.</p>

<p>29th, Moved to left and rear of Fort Hayes.</p>

<p>30th, 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, Deployed along the works between Forts
Hayes and Davis, the enemy having relieved, very
quietly, about 300 men on our picket line, the pickets
supposing they were being regularly relieved.</p>

<p>The mistake was discovered in time to avoid any disadvantage
therefrom.</p>

<p>Regiment back in quarters before morning.</p>

<p>November 1st, Changed position to right of Fort
Hayes, and put up tents along main line of works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>5th, 12 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, Rebel dash on picket line, with no success,
but with loss of 40 of their men captured.</p>

<p>Quiet until the 18th, when orders were received to
be ready to move, but prevented by heavy rain.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Thanksgiving Dinner.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">25th, Memorable as the day when the whole Army

<p>29th, Orders received to move at dark. 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
moved to near Southall House.</p>

<p>30th, 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, Marched along rear line of works,
about 5 miles, to between Forts Emory and Seibert, and
commenced putting up quarters.</p>

<p>December 1st, Ordered to change camp, and</p>

<p>On the 2d, moved about a mile, and commenced the
erection of Winter Quarters.</p>

<p class="p2">4th, A, C, E and K Companies mustered out as
company organizations, having completed three years'
service.</p>

<p class="p2">6th, Ordered to march at daylight of the 7th.</p>

<p>It was now quite evident that the Winter of '64-5
was not to be as other Winters had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Destruction of Weldon Railroad.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the 7th, Mott's Division marched out with the
5th Corps and the Cavalry, the whole under command
of Warren, under orders to destroy as much as possible
of the Weldon Railroad. Went by way of the Jerusalem
Plank Road, crossed the Nottoway River at dark,
and bivouacked on the South side, 20 miles.</p>

<p>8th, Marched at daylight, passed through Sussex
Court House and Coman's Well, 12 miles, and
bivouacked for the night within 2 miles of the Weldon
Railroad.</p>

<p>9th, Daylight, marched 2 miles, striking the Weldon
Railroad near Jarrett's Station. From this point
Southward to Bellefield, a distance of 11 miles, the
Railroad was effectually destroyed.</p>

<p>10th, The object of the Expedition having been
accomplished, Warren started backward toward Petersburg,
marched 18 miles, and bivouacked for the night
4 miles South of Sussex Court House.</p>

<p>11th, Started at daylight, again passed through
Sussex Court House, recrossed the Nottoway River,
stopping for the night 4 miles beyond, 11 miles.</p>

<p>12th, Off again at daylight, the Regiment deployed
as flankers, and back at our lines at 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, 16 miles.</p>

<p>There were no casualties, except as will be stated, no
rebel force having been encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way back it was discovered that several
Union soldiers had been murdered by guerillas, their
bodies having been found in the woods, off the line of
march, horribly mutilated.</p>

<p>On the way down they had strayed from the road to
lie down, being overcome by too free indulgence in the
discovery made at one of the houses, not knowing its
powerful after-effect. It was a terrible sequel to the
over-taking of the seeming harmlessness of Apple Jack,
to one not acquainted with its ardent qualities.</p>

<p>The result of the discovery of the bodies was the
order given to burn every house and other building
anywhere near the line of march.</p>

<p>13th, Moved into the woods and took position in line
for the purpose of laying out camp and putting up
quarters.</p>

<p>14th, Erection of Winter Quarters.</p>

<p class="p2">22d, Expiration of three years since muster of the
Regiment into the Service of the United States.</p>

<p class="p2">23d, Division paraded to witness the execution of
John E. Dixon, Private 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery,
for desertion. Dixon had made a break for the
rebel line, but not noticing the direction of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lines, ran into our own line without knowing it, when
it was learned from his words and manner that he
supposed he was on the other side, and that his purpose
had been to desert.</p>

<p class="p2">31st, Regiment consolidated into Battalion of 4 Companies.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Consolidation of the 84th and 57th Pa.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">This formation was preparatory to the consolidation
of the Regiment with the 57th Pennsylvania, which
had been made a Battalion of 6 Companies.</p>

<p>The consolidation took place on January 13th, 1865.</p>

<p>The consolidation was not a merger, save as to number.
The 57th composed the Right 6 Companies and
the 84th the Left 4 Companies.</p>

<p>I will venture what I think the explanation of the
dropping of the number 84 and the retention of the
number 57, notwithstanding it was known that the
Colonel, Major and Adjutant of the Consolidated Regiment
would be from the 84th. But it was also known
that the retention of the number 84 would work great
injustice to officers who had earned further promotion,
and therefore the natural course of the command of the
Regiment determining the number, must give way to
the necessity which justice prompted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Bowman was still borne on the rolls of the
84th, though his service in the field was less than a
year, and only half that time directly with the Regiment,
and then on permanent Detached Service at
Washington since June, 1863. It was known that he
would not return to Field Service.</p>

<p>With the number 57, Lieutenant-Colonel Zinn was
promoted Colonel; Captain Bryan, Major; and Captain
Perkins, of the old 57th, Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>

<p>Captain Bryan had been commissioned Major of the
84th in May, '64, nearly a year before, but could not
be mustered as such for want of the minimum number
admitting of 3 Field Officers, although there was not
the 1 Field Officer doing duty with the Regiment.</p>

<p>Colonel Bowman continued to rank as of the 84th
until the middle of May, when he was mustered out, a
month after the close of the War.</p>

<p>That portion of the Inscription on the Monument
which brings the 84th down to the date of the muster
out of the 57th, was conceded only after months of
earnest contention.</p>

<p>The 57th continued in Pierce's Brigade.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Second Hatcher's Run.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the day that Lee arranged the assault intended
to compel Grant to abandon his Petersburg Line, and
thus raise the Siege of Petersburg, Grant issued the
order for the movement of the 29th. Had Lee met
with success on the 25th, Grant's program to end the
War at this time would have failed.</p>

<p>29th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, left camp near Humphrey's Station,
marched along Vaughan Road 3 miles, and formed line
on right of the road. Advanced 2 miles and bivouacked

put up works.</p>

<p>31st, 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, moved 1 mile to left, and bivouacked for

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Pursuit of Lee.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">3d, 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, marched Westward on road to Burk's
Station in pursuit of Lee, 20 miles.</p>

bivouacked.</p>

<p>5th, 1.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, in same direction. Crossed Richmond
and Danville Railroad, and bivouacked 1 mile North
of the Road, 12 miles.</p>

<p>6th, 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, in close pursuit of Lee.</p>

<p>Portion of Regiment on Skirmish Line, continually
running into Lee's rear guard skirmishers, capturing

the enemy in force after marching about 8 miles. 2
men wounded.</p>

<p>8th, passed through Coal Land, marching 17 miles.
Took 40 prisoners.</p>

<p>For the last three days broken-down rebel wagons,
gun carriages and soldiers were a common sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surrender of Lee's Army.</span></p>

<p>April 9th, the Last Day.</p>

<p>Still in close pursuit. Went 5 miles, driving the
enemy. 12 o'clock, ordered to halt until 2. 2 o'clock,
ordered to halt until 4, before which hour Lee had surrendered
to Grant the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>The Regiment was with the advance, and about 4
miles East of Appomattox Court House.</p>

<p class="p2">Who would attempt to word the feeling following
upon the announcement of the surrender that Sunday
afternoon, April 9th, 1865?</p>

<p class="p2">April 11th, 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, journeyed back 12 miles to New
Store, away from what had been Lee's Army, and
without seeing it.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">No Pickets Out.&mdash;No Guards On.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">From two things we knew the surrender had been
made. The fact of the announcement and the other
fact&mdash;there had been no pickets out, no guard on, since
the 9th. But there had been no parading of a vanquished
foe to meet the gaze of a triumphant Army.
Grant had saved them that humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>12th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 15 miles, passed through Curville, and
then on to Farmville.</p>

<p>13th, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 17 miles, to near Burks Station, and
went into camp.</p>

of President Lincoln on the night of the 14th,
and his death at 7.22 o'clock on the morning of the
15th.</p>

<p>He had lived to the last day of a labor which none
but himself could know how hard it had been to bear.
But now how absolute his rest. The very Heaven his
immediate reward for the saving, under God, of a
Nation.</p>

<p>16th, Moved one-third of a mile to change camp.</p>

<p>19th, Ordered that all unnecessary work be suspended
on the day of the President's funeral.</p>

<p>25th, Regiment paraded to hear orders relative to the
assassination. Officers directed to wear crape for six
months and Colors to be draped for the same period.</p>

the Pontoon Bridge over the James River, marched

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Order for Muster-Out.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">29th, on which day was read on Dress Parade the
Order that made, as other citizens, save in the service
they had completed for their Country, the Soldiers who
comprised the Field Survivors of the 84th and 57th
Regiments Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers.</p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">Back to Harrisburg.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">From camp near Washington to Harrisburg, there a
closing of accounts with the Government that had, with
the loss of 400,000 Loyal Lives and the crippling of
300,000 Union Soldiers, and the agonies of the sorrows
which never could be told off, been made altogether
free.</p>

<p class="p2">Into the hands of each Comrade was placed a printed
copy of the following paper: "Parting as a Band of
Brothers, let us cling to the memory of those tattered
banners, under which we have fought together, and
which, without dishonor, we have just now restored to
the authorities who placed them in our hands. Till we
grow gray-headed and pass away, let us sustain the
reputation of this noble Regiment.</p>

<p>"Fortune threw together two organizations, the 84th
and 57th, to make the present command. Both Regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
have been in the service since the beginning of
the strife, and the records of both will command respect
in all coming time. Very many of those who were
enrolled with us have fallen, and their graves are scattered
here and there throughout the South. We shall
not forget them, and the people of this Nation must
and will honor their memory. Comrades, Farewell."</p>

<p>Then with certificates of Honorable Muster-Out, all
matters of detail faithfully completed, and the 8th day
of July, 1865, at hand, the "Old Regimental Home"
was gone, and forever.</p>

<p class="p2">The War is over! But not so with its splendid
achievements, its grand and far reaching results.</p>

<p>Never was conflict waged to a better and surer end.
Never a result attained bearing so completely upon
true Governmental Economy.</p>

<p>To the Revolution of '75 we are indebted for the
rebellion of '61. The Revolution stands out the more
grandly because of the resulting text&mdash;the rebellion.
The rejection of the latter was the upholding of the
principles of the former; posterity's emphatic endorsement
of a valued ancestry.</p>

<p>Victories may be great, but not always just. Conquerors
have vanquished peoples and thereby encompassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
countries within their toils, and then regretted
there was not more to do on the same line. But their
doing was only the accomplishment of personal gain,
the satisfaction of selfish purpose. With them war was
a thing sought after, not a calamity to be avoided.</p>

<p>Justice was not their polar star, nor did they seek
the moral sphere as the place of their habitation. With
them war was a vocation ordinary, and life and morals
considerations secondary. Public standing and landed
interests were made to depend upon military record.
Conquered territory was divided as would be now the
spoils of the theft, among the participators in the act and
in proportion to the extent of the service done. What a
mistake, how grievous a wrong, to review on the printed
page the tenacity of an Alexander, or the vigor of a
Napoleon, for the purpose of comparing the wars of
their armies with the deeds of patriotism and of valor
that moved the six fighting years of the Revolution, or
the four years of the rebellion.</p>

<p>No man this side the Atlantic forced the Revolution.
It was the outcome of oppression that ill fitted a people
who had crossed from the other shore, not to bear
greater burden, but that they might be full free from
the crush of wrong. In its beginning not aggressive,
but defensive. A year passed by before it was determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that the yoke should be fully thrown off and
absolute independence moved for.</p>

<p>And so it was, when along in the after years came
the overt acts of treason that were to force States into
rebellion, against the will of their people, every effort,
reasonable and unreasonable, was made to conciliate the
men whose only desire was not Union, but disintegration.
So far did some of the most prominently active,
and, I may add, patriotic men of our Country, go in
their determination to avoid a resort to arms, that the
very amendment to the Constitution of these United
States that forever forbids the institution of slavery,
would have been, in number, the amendment that would
have fastened slavery upon the Country forever, had it
not been that just then treason grasped for too much
and thereby lost all. Now, when all is safe, it moves
us to a condition of agony to recall that in the Winter
of '60 and '61, so weighty was the power of the then
South, that among the men of our Country, those of
best repute, were found so many, who, to avert war,
were ready to surrender everything, save the theory of
a Central Government for all the States, and the bare
privilege to <i>look</i> at the Old Flag.</p>

<p>Our Country is great, our Government is powerful,
but no thanks are owing to compromisers for the greatness
of the one or the power of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Treason's eagerness for the capture of <i>all</i> saved one
generation from the commission of a wrong that the
good deeds of all the coming generations could not
have atoned for.</p>

<p><i>It is well to be on guard always.</i></p>

<p>And what of the present?</p>

<p>The once soldiers of the confederacy are entitled, as
individuals, to every manly consideration at our hands;
as individuals they are as we are, men walking the
journey of life, reaching out to one common goal. But
their organized bodies have no claim upon us for recognition.
The Government should have taken the life
from every "camp" at the birth, and its strong arm
should have swept from its soil the first monument to
rebellion, with the warning that the placing of the
second would be known as treason.</p>

<p>They have been asking that the War be forgotten,
and yet they would keep us daily reminded by the
flaunting of the confederate bars.</p>

<p>No monument to treason should have been permitted
a place on this or other Field, and being here should be
returned to the donors, not to be erected elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>No Government is strong enough to glorify treason
against itself, nor to encourage it anywhere.</i></p>

<p>The individual I would take most heartily by the
hand, the organization I discard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no true call for a union of the blue and
the gray. Let all don the blue. In place of waiting for
the chasm to be closed, flank it and locate upon our
side. The chasm itself can do no harm. It will be a
thing well to look upon at times, and take warning
from as the divider of great depth and impassable
width.</p>

<p>As in Heaven, so in Earth, to dwell together as
brothers, all must be of one mind, patriots upholding
the one Flag, standing fast by the Red, White and
Blue.</p>

<p>When true history of our day comes to be written,
all things will be made plain. With the faithful historian,
it is not the question of the doing, but of the
thing done. Just as when we look upon the completed
work of the sculptor, or the finished touch of the
painter, it is not of the marble, or the canvas and the
material laid upon it that we think, but of the figure
before us, as we note perfection in every line, and see
life in the seeming light of the eye, and apparent
movement of muscle.</p>

<p>History gives little heed to men, save to designate
the moral character of the age.</p>

<p>And now, Comrades, for the part taken by the 84th
Regiment Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers in the
setting of the page which will commemorate the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of our time, a grateful Commonwealth has placed upon
this spot this weight of granite.</p>

<p>To the living it is, and to the people yet to come it
will be, the visible proof of the deeds of heroism which
located a part of the life of the men who bore the
names that make up the Roll of a Command, whose
record among the Archives of the Nation is without
the semblance of a blur or particle of a stain. Clear,
positive, clean cut all the way through. Do we advance
<i>sentiment</i> only, when we say that such a body did not,
could not have died in '65? Is there nothing of substance,
nothing real, to come out of the thought, that
as our Country lives, so we as a Regiment go on, living
in the freedom of a land and the stability of a Government,
neither of which would now be, without sentiment,
the spring of human life?</p>

<p>The Memorial which is here placed speaks from all
along the line, from Bath to Appomattox.</p>

<p>For the moment it moves aside, and where it was,
and within the lengthening of its shadow, we see them
all, and as we glance from right to left, from front to
rear, one is taken from here, another from there, one by
one, from the highest in rank to the lowest, from the
oldest in years to the youngest, the man and the boy;
first the 230 in the time of the War, then the many
who have left us in the days that have intervened; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
then comes the Shaft into the space which was made
for it. We look upon it now, and know that it stands
for <i>them</i>. The time is coming when it will stand for <i>all</i>
whose names made up a Regimental Roll.</p>

<p><i>Then</i>, and not till then, shall we know that our work
here is <i>fully</i> done.</p>

<p class="p2">Two years ago, at the Reunion held at Huntingdon,
a Committee was appointed to secure for our Regiment
the benefit of the Act of Assembly appropriating money
for the purchase of Monuments for Pennsylvania Commands
and their erection on the Field of Gettysburg.
I will not enter upon a recital of the details of that
Committee's work, but simply report that it is completed.</p>

<p>In so far as it may be the part of the Committee so
to do, I now on its behalf turn over to you, Captain
Johnson, as the Vice-President of the Regimental
Association and its acting President, and as such the
Representative of the Survivors of the 84th, this
Memorial of its Service in the War of the Rebellion.</p>
